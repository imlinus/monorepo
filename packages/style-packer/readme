I love SCSS, but these days most of the good parts are built-in
However, I still want to bundle my files and write nestled styles

style-packer.config.js

```
import StylePacker from '@imlinus/style-packer'

new StylePacker({
	input: 'source/stylesheet.css',
	output: 'build/stylesheet.css'
})
```

See packages/stylesheet for an example
